However, there are some hints showing that there can be relationships between these factors, for example:\n",

    "* neighbourhoods with parks, trails and other natural venues tend to have higher average rent prices.\n",

    "Nevertheless, we can state that more frequent presence of any specific type of venues does not play a key role in defining rent prices in any of the  neighbourhoods. Actually, looking at the maps we can state that georgraphic location plays a more if not most critical role in defining the rental prices for accomodation. We should also consider presence of key infrastructure, such as public transportation, schools and universities, which provide a comfortable living experience in a given neighbourhood.\n"
